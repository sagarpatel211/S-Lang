<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
A Programming Language for GenZ! I got into wanting to design my own programming language after watching a quick [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BT2Cv-Tjq7Q) about [LLVM](https://llvm.org/) from [Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship). I then began with learning to use LLVM through their [Kaleidoscope tutorial](https://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/) and worked from there :)!
