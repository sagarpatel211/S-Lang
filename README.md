## To Do
- [ ] Finish ReadME
- [ ] Finish language
- [ ] Write syntax documentation and examples for fib and something else

When compiling, it does:
Parsing -> Abstract Syntax Tree -> Code Generator
Parsing is considered the front end and Code generator is considered the backend, LLVM automates the backend so we only have to do the frontend!
