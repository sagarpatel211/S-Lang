# To Do

- [ ] Get Project to work with LLVM
- [ ] Finish README.md
- [ ] Create Language documentation and link terminology to Urban Dictionary (for the old folks of course)
- [ ] Set Github Packages so users can download for their systems rather than compiling
- [ ] Check it works for Windows >_<
- [ ] Write Dockerfile and Docker-Compose
- [ ] Add multiple files to main.cpp so it can compile multiple object files at the same time, and potentially link them
